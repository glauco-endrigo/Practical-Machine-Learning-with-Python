    "We are gonna be doing this buy covering a variety of algorithms, so first we are gonna be covering regression when we are going to be movingitno classification with knearst-neighbors and support vector machines and then we are going to get into clustering with flat clustering, hierarchical clustering and then finally we will be getting  into deep learning with neural networks \n",
